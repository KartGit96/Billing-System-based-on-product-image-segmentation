# Billing-System-based-on-product-image-segmentation
Team designed a GPU-based Billing System using Deep Learning RetinaNet and FaceNet to identify a product and a person respectively, to reduce checkout times at shopping facilities. The Machine learning algorithm designed identifies an image of the object and face based on the trained images of different orientations (about 20-25 different images for each product and face). Started at an accuracy of identifying test images at 40% and improved it upto 98-99% (minimized error rate based on a generated inference score).
